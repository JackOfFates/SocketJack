SocketJack.WPF 2026 adds live WPF control sharing, remote input, and browser-friendly remote administration to the SocketJack networking platform.

Share any `FrameworkElement` as a live image stream, view it from another peer, and route remote mouse, wheel, text, and keyboard input back into WPF without moving the real Windows cursor.

## #Versions

| Package / surface | Version | Target |
|---|---:|---|
| [`SocketJack.WPF`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SocketJack.WPF) | `2026.5` | `net8.0-windows7.0`, `net10.0-windows7.0` |
| [`SocketJack`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SocketJack) | `2026.9` | `.NET Standard 2.1` |

<summary><strong>#Install</strong> - add WPF remote control to a SocketJack app</summary>

```powershell
dotnet add package SocketJack.WPF
```

Or with Package Manager:

```powershell
Install-Package SocketJack.WPF
```

Use this package when the network should see, share, or control a WPF UI. Use the core `SocketJack` package by itself when you only need TCP, UDP, HTTP, WebSockets, SQL/data, streaming, and peer routing.

<summary><strong>#What It Does</strong> - live capture, remote viewing, and direct WPF input</summary>

| Capability | What it means |
|---|---|
| Live capture | Stream any `FrameworkElement`, including panels, canvases, controls, or windows. |
| Viewer integration | Decode incoming frames into WPF image controls with a small extension-method surface. |
| Remote input | Forward pointer movement, clicks, wheel events, text, and keyboard commands to WPF. |
| Peer transport | Ride on SocketJack connections, peer identity, and metadata flows. |
| Browser control | Power browser-backed viewing and remote administration for WPF applications. |
| Shared core stack | Benefit from SocketJack 2026 TCP, UDP, HTTP, WebSocket, `MutableTcpServer`, RTMP, SQL/TDS, TLS, compression, and P2P support. |

<summary><strong>#How It Works</strong> - host, stream, view, and control</summary>

1. A WPF host shares a `FrameworkElement` over a connected SocketJack peer.
2. SocketJack.WPF captures the element as JPEG frames at the configured frame rate.
3. A viewer renders frames into an `Image`.
4. Viewer input is translated into WPF actions and sent back to the original element.
5. Browser clients can use the same path to operate an authorized WPF interface.

```csharp
using SocketJack.WPF;

IDisposable shareHandle = GameCanvas.Share(client, remotePeer, fps: 10);
IDisposable viewerHandle = client.ViewShare(SharedImage, sharerPeer);
```
